# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 3.0

We have bumped the chart version to 3.0 in order to take in several major changes in our chart dependencies, some of which require
manual actions to complete the upgrade.

- TODO add summary list of major changes (ie postgresql,redis,prometheus) as their MRs are merged.

## Upgrade path from 2.x

This means that in order to upgrade to the 3.0 version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `2.6.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

If you don't first upgrade to the latest `2.6.x` patch, you will see the following error from `helm upgrade`

```bash
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: Job failed: BackoffLimitExceeded
```

You can then confirm you are in this situation by looking for pods in error with the text `gitlab-upgrade-check` in the name.

If you check the logs for those pods will see the version upgrade error message.

```
It seems you are upgrading the GitLab Helm Chart from X (GitLab X) to 3.0.0 (GitLab 12.6.2).
It is required to upgrade to the last minor version in a major version series
first before jumping to the next major version.
Please follow the upgrade documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/3_0.html
and upgrade to GitLab Helm Chart version 2.6.0 before upgrading to 3.0.0.
```

### TODO Upgrade instructions for components

We should have a section for the manual postgres steps, and seperate sections for any other upgrade steps for other components.

## Release cadence

We will be releasing a new version of the chart with each new GitLab patch.

More information on how we are versioning the chart can be found in the [release documentation](../development/release.md).

Along with the issues and merge requests in this repo, a [changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is available to more easily follow along with updates.

## Kubernetes deployment support

GitLab is tested against:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
- [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

Other Kubernetes deployments should also work. In the event of a specific non-GKE deployment issue, please raise an issue.

We are currently using Kubernetes version 1.12.10 in our automated tests, and 1.13.11 for development.
